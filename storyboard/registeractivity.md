# Deer Diary: [Register Activity](https://github.com/cunychenhclass/cisc3171proj-group6/issues/1)
When the user clicks on *Register* on the starting activity or *Register Here* on the login activity, the user will be routed to this page. Here the user is given
four text fields to fill out during the account creation process.
### On Success
- All four fields are filled out correctly and when the user clicks on the *Register* button, the user account is successfully created and a verification email is sent out.
- After the button is clicked, the user is routed to the login activity

### On Failure
- Of the four fields, at least one was incorrectly filled out and the app will prompt the user to change the field(s) with error
- An account already has been made with the email

### Further Information
- If the user already made an account, the user can click on *login Here* to login
