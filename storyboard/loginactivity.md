# Deer Diary: [Login Activity](https://github.com/cunychenhclass/cisc3171proj-group6/issues/2)

When the user clicks on the login button on the starting activity or *Login Here* on the register activity, it routes the user to this page. Here, users are prompted to enter the fields: email and password,
for user authentication. 
- On Success: The user is routed to the homepage of the app
- On Failure: Login fails and the app will prompt the user what the error was during the login process

### Further Information
- If the user is not registered, the user has the opportunity to create an account by clicking on *Register Here* to be routed to the registration page.
