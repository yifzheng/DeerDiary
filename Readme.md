# Deer Diary

### Digitize a traditional diary
An Android application that can digitally take entries and to-do tasks

### createPost(content)
Sends a POST request to the backend with the content as the payload.

### editPost(content, id)
Send a PUT request to the backend with the content Id and content body and update the instance in the database.

### deletePost(id)
Sends a DELETE request to the backend and deletes the post with the corresponding id from the backend.

### Reminder
Each post has a due date and we can create an alert when the task has not been completed

## Reflection
- The first iteration of this Android project attempts to implement the following issues: user registration, user login, sort/display entries, create entry, and view entry. The time span of this iteration was two weeks and within this timeframe, we were able to implement majority of these issues/features to create a mimimum viable product. Users are now able to create an account on our app, login with their account, view a list and indiviudal existing diary entries, and create a diary entry. The only feature we have yet to fully implement was the sorting feature that filters the way the list of entries are displayed. 
- Through this iteration, we have learned a lot regarding commuinication and productivity. In terms of communication, the clarity and responsefulness of the team members were not ideal especially the response time between a notice might be two to three hours later. In terms of productivity, while we might have completed most of the issues for our first iteration, there wasn't much done throughout the given time span. Consequently, work had to be rushed while quality control isn't ideal. With these lessons, we believe that we can improve our communication and productivity in the next iteration.
