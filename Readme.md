# Deer Diary

### Digitize a traditional diary
An Android application that can digitally take entries and to-do tasks

### createPost(content)
Sends a POST request to the backend with the content as the payload.

### editPost(content, id)
Send a PUT request to the backend with the content Id and content body and update the instance in the database.

### deletePost(id)
Sends a DELETE request to the backend and deletes the post with the corresponding id from the backend.

### Reminder
Each post has a due date and we can create an alert when the task has not been completed
